### Goals
 - The trainee will learn about different products and their applications
 - The trainee will know how to compare between competing products

### Tasks
- Search and shortly review products that provide solutions for the following needs (if you find a specific-cloud dependent product, try to also bring an example for something similar that's not):
  - Real time data streaming
  - Text search and log aggregation
  - Stream processing
  - ETL processing
  - Distributed file system with a lot of reads
  - Query engine that can query multiple types of data sources simultaneously
  - End to end modular dataflow manager
- For each of the products you've brought try to find a product with similar purpose, and write a high-level (not in-depth) comparison between the two. 
  Try to determine which is better for an on-premise environment like ours. 
  Rely on the knowledge you have about our environment and future plans in order to come to a conclusion.
  Each comparison must be no longer than one page and written with a high level of technical language and proper phrasing.
